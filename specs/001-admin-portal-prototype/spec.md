# Feature Specification: Admin Portal Prototype

**Feature Branch**: `001-admin-portal-prototype`
**Created**: October 23, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Admin Portal front-end prototype for configuring spreadsheet inputs and outputs"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Map Named Cells to Inputs and Outputs (Priority: P1)

An administrator opens the Admin Portal to configure a spreadsheet for use in the Calculation Engine. They need to identify which named cells on specific sheets will serve as inputs (where users provide values) and which will serve as outputs (calculated results to display). The administrator maps each named cell, assigns it a descriptive label, and specifies whether it's an input or output.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the Admin Portal. Without the ability to map and label cells, no configuration can be created. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new configuration, adding at least one input cell mapping and one output cell mapping with labels, and verifying the mappings are displayed correctly in the interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the administrator has opened the Admin Portal, **When** they add a new named cell and specify it as an input with label "Loan Amount", **Then** the system displays the input mapping with the label in the configuration list
2. **Given** the administrator has created input mappings, **When** they add a new named cell and specify it as an output with label "Monthly Payment", **Then** the system displays the output mapping with the label separately from inputs
3. **Given** the administrator has multiple cell mappings, **When** they remove a mapping, **Then** the system removes it from the configuration list immediately
4. **Given** the administrator has no cell mappings, **When** they view the configuration, **Then** the system displays an empty state with instructions to add mappings

### User Story 2 - Define Data Types for Inputs (Priority: P2)

After mapping named cells to inputs, the administrator needs to specify what type of data each input accepts. They can choose from common data types such as number, text, percentage, currency, or date. This ensures that when users interact with the Calculation Engine, they provide data in the correct format.

**Why this priority**: Data type definitions enable validation and proper data handling. While not strictly required for basic mapping, it's essential for creating a usable configuration that prevents errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting an existing input mapping and assigning different data types to it, then verifying the data type is displayed and can be changed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator has created an input mapping, **When** they select a data type from the available options (number, text, percentage, currency, date), **Then** the system saves and displays the selected data type for that input
2. **Given** an input mapping exists without a data type, **When** the administrator views it, **Then** the system indicates that a data type needs to be assigned
3. **Given** an input mapping has a data type assigned, **When** the administrator changes the data type, **Then** the system updates the mapping with the new data type

---

### User Story 3 - Configure Value Constraints (Priority: P3)

For certain inputs, administrators need to restrict the possible values users can enter. They can define either a discrete set of allowed values (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High") or a continuous range with minimum and maximum bounds (e.g., 0 to 100). These constraints help ensure data quality and prevent invalid calculations.

**Why this priority**: Value constraints enhance data quality but aren't required for basic configuration. They can be added after the core mapping and data type functionality is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting an input mapping and adding either discrete value options or a continuous range, then verifying the constraints are saved and displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator has an input mapping, **When** they choose to define discrete values and enter "Low, Medium, High", **Then** the system saves these as allowed values for that input
2. **Given** an administrator has an input mapping with a numeric data type, **When** they specify a continuous range with minimum 0 and maximum 100, **Then** the system saves these bounds for that input
3. **Given** an input has value constraints defined, **When** the administrator views the mapping, **Then** the system displays the constraints clearly (either the list of values or the range)
4. **Given** an input has discrete values defined, **When** the administrator attempts to also define a continuous range, **Then** the system prevents this and indicates only one constraint type can be used

---

### User Story 4 - Generate and Export JSON Configuration (Priority: P1)

Once the administrator has configured all cell mappings, data types, and constraints, they need to generate a JSON configuration file. This JSON captures all the metadata and will be used in the Calculation Engine. The administrator can copy the JSON to their clipboard or download it as a file.

**Why this priority**: Generating the JSON output is essential for the Admin Portal to fulfill its purpose. Without this, the configuration cannot be used in the Calculation Engine. This is part of the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a complete configuration with at least one input and one output, generating the JSON, and verifying it contains the correct structure and data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the administrator has created a complete configuration, **When** they request to generate JSON, **Then** the system produces valid JSON containing all cell mappings, labels, data types, and constraints
2. **Given** the JSON has been generated, **When** the administrator clicks to copy to clipboard, **Then** the system copies the JSON text and provides visual confirmation
3. **Given** the JSON has been generated, **When** the administrator chooses to download, **Then** the system initiates a file download with a descriptive filename (e.g., "spreadsheet-config-2025-10-23.json")
4. **Given** the configuration is incomplete or has validation errors, **When** the administrator attempts to generate JSON, **Then** the system displays clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

---

### User Story 5 - Save and Load Configuration Drafts (Priority: P3)

Administrators working on complex spreadsheet configurations may need multiple sessions to complete their work. They can save their work-in-progress configuration to the browser's local storage and reload it later to continue editing. They can also clear a draft to start fresh.

**Why this priority**: This is a quality-of-life feature that improves the user experience but isn't required for basic functionality. Users can always generate JSON immediately or keep their browser open.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a partial configuration, saving it, closing/reopening the application, and verifying the configuration is restored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the administrator has made changes to a configuration, **When** they click save draft, **Then** the system persists the configuration to local storage and confirms the save
2. **Given** a saved draft exists, **When** the administrator opens the Admin Portal, **Then** the system automatically loads the most recent draft
3. **Given** a saved draft exists, **When** the administrator clicks to clear the draft, **Then** the system prompts for confirmation before clearing and resets to an empty configuration
4. **Given** no saved draft exists, **When** the administrator opens the Admin Portal, **Then** the system starts with an empty configuration

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an administrator enters a named cell reference that contains special characters or spaces?
- How does the system handle when an administrator tries to create duplicate mappings for the same named cell?
- What happens if the administrator defines a minimum value greater than the maximum value in a continuous range?
- How does the system behave if local storage is full or unavailable when attempting to save a draft?
- What happens when an administrator provides an empty string for a discrete value in the value set?
- How does the system handle very long labels or cell names that might affect the layout?
