# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin Portal Prototype

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 23, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: October 23, 2025

**Content Quality Review**:

- ✓ Specification focuses on WHAT administrators need and WHY, not HOW to implement
- ✓ Written for business stakeholders with clear user stories
- ✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- ✓ No technology stack, frameworks, or implementation details mentioned

**Requirement Completeness Review**:

- ✓ All requirements are testable with clear Given-When-Then scenarios
- ✓ Success criteria are measurable (time under 5 minutes, 95% completion rate, 200ms feedback, etc.)
- ✓ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not system internals)
- ✓ Edge cases cover boundary conditions (special characters, duplicates, validation, storage limits)
- ✓ Scope clearly bounded with Assumptions and Out of Scope sections
- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and unambiguous

**Feature Readiness Review**:

- ✓ 24 functional requirements with clear, testable outcomes
- ✓ 5 prioritized user stories covering the complete workflow from cell mapping to JSON export
- ✓ Measurable success criteria aligned with user value (completion time, usability, performance)
- ✓ Specification is ready for planning and implementation

## Status

✅ **APPROVED** - Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

All checklist items pass validation. The specification provides a clear, complete, and technology-agnostic description of the Admin Portal prototype feature.
